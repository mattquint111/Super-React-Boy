Super React Boy is video game emulator built entirely in React.js. It features both single and multiplayer games and can be played both on desktop and mobile devices. The concept of this app is modular in nature so check back to see what new games are added.


## Inspiration
This app was inspired by the first generation 8-bit Game Boy console with they style designed to emulate the feel of the Game Boy's green dot matrix screen. The games that you want to play over and over don't always need the most advanced graphics just a fun concept with simple controls. Like all good video games this app contains easter eggs on each page, see if you can find all the secret kiwis.
